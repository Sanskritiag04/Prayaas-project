      <p>
        Our mission is to bridge the gap between social organizations and
        individuals who want to make a difference. We aim to simplify
        volunteering, increase community participation, and ensure that every
        effort contributes to measurable social impact.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where volunteering is accessible to everyone and
        NGOs have the support they need to create lasting positive change across
        communities.
